The A2A protocol has opened up a new category of developer tooling: code generation agents that can be discovered, composed, and orchestrated over HTTP. Instead of being locked into a single AI coding assistant, you can now connect multiple specialized agents into a pipeline that handles everything from writing code to reviewing pull requests.

This guide covers the best A2A agents for code generation available today, what makes each one unique, and when to pick one over another.

## Quick Comparison

| Agent | Framework | Language | Official | Streaming | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Github Agent | Custom (Python) | Python | Yes | No | PR reviews, issue triage |
| Code Agent | Pydantic AI + Modal | Python | No | No | General code generation |
| Ag2 (AutoGen) | AutoGen | Python | Yes | No | Multi-agent code workflows |
| Semantic Kernel A2A | Semantic Kernel | C# | No | No | .NET enterprise codebases |
| Artinet SDK | LangChain | TypeScript | No | No | Rapid A2A agent bootstrapping |

## Github Agent (Official Sample)

**Repository:** [a2aproject/a2a-samples/github-agent](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents/github-agent)

The Github Agent is an official A2A sample that connects directly to the GitHub API. It handles repository operations like reviewing pull requests, triaging issues, and analyzing code diffs. Because it is part of the official A2A samples repository, it follows the spec closely and serves as a reference implementation.

**What it does:**

- Reviews pull request diffs and provides feedback
- Triages issues by analyzing content and applying labels
- Queries repository metadata (stars, contributors, recent activity)
- Searches code across repositories

**Strengths:**

- Official sample maintained by the A2A Project, so it tracks spec changes quickly
- Clean Python implementation that is easy to fork and extend
- Uses the A2A Python SDK directly, no extra framework layer
- Apache 2.0 license

**When to use it:**

Pick the Github Agent when you need a reliable PR review agent in your pipeline or want a starting point for building GitHub-integrated A2A services. It works well as a downstream agent that a coordinator calls after code is generated by another agent.

```python
from a2a.client import A2AClient

client = A2AClient(url="http://localhost:9000")
response = await client.send_message(
    message={
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Review PR #42 in my-org/my-repo"}]
    }
)
```

## Code Agent

**Repository:** [prassanna-ravishankar/a2a-agent-bootstrapping](https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/a2a-agent-bootstrapping)

Code Agent is a general-purpose code generation agent built with Pydantic AI and deployed on Modal. It handles generation, review, debugging, and optimization across multiple programming languages. Unlike the GitHub Agent, which focuses on repository operations, Code Agent is about writing and improving code directly.

**What it does:**

- Generates code from natural language descriptions
- Reviews existing code for bugs, performance issues, and best practices
- Debugs error traces and suggests fixes
- Optimizes code for performance or readability

**Strengths:**

- Hosted on Modal, so you can call it without running your own infrastructure
- Accepts both plain text and JSON input, making it flexible for different orchestration patterns
- Supports Python, TypeScript, and Java SDKs for client integration
- Published Agent Card at a live endpoint for immediate discovery

**When to use it:**

Code Agent is a good fit when you need a hosted, general-purpose coding assistant that you can call from any A2A client. It is particularly useful in multi-agent setups where one agent plans the work and delegates code writing to Code Agent.

```bash
# Discover the agent
curl https://prassanna-ravishankar--code-agent-code-agent-app.modal.run/.well-known/agent.json
```

## Ag2 (AutoGen) Agent

**Repository:** [a2aproject/a2a-samples/ag2](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents/ag2)

The Ag2 agent is the official A2A sample built on Microsoft's AutoGen (AG2) framework. AutoGen specializes in multi-agent conversations where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve problems. The A2A wrapper exposes this capability over the standard protocol, letting any A2A client trigger an AutoGen workflow.

**What it does:**

- Runs multi-agent conversations where a "coder" agent writes code and a "reviewer" agent validates it
- Handles iterative refinement loops automatically
- Supports complex problem decomposition across multiple agents

**Strengths:**

- Built on AutoGen's battle-tested multi-agent orchestration
- Self-correcting: the internal reviewer agent catches mistakes before returning results
- Official sample with Apache 2.0 license
- Python SDK support

**When to use it:**

Choose Ag2 when your code generation tasks benefit from internal debate. For example, generating a complex algorithm where having a second agent verify correctness before returning the result reduces error rates significantly. It trades latency for accuracy since multiple rounds of internal conversation take more time.

## Semantic Kernel A2A (.NET)

**Repository:** [SiddyHub/a2a-semantic-kernel-dotnet](https://github.com/SiddyHub/a2a-semantic-kernel-dotnet)

This agent integrates Microsoft's Semantic Kernel with the A2A protocol in a .NET environment. It leverages dynamic Semantic Kernel functions and an Agent Card Repository for adaptive workflows. If your team works in C# and Azure, this is the most natural path to A2A code generation.

**What it does:**

- Exposes Semantic Kernel functions as A2A skills
- Dynamically discovers and registers new functions via an Agent Card Repository
- Integrates with Azure OpenAI for LLM calls
- Supports multi-agent orchestration within the Semantic Kernel framework

**Strengths:**

- First-class .NET and C# support
- Deep Azure OpenAI integration
- Enterprise-friendly: fits into existing .NET microservice architectures
- Adaptive workflows that can pick up new agent capabilities at runtime

**When to use it:**

Semantic Kernel A2A is the right choice for .NET shops that want to expose their existing Semantic Kernel investments as A2A agents. It is also a strong option if you need agents that dynamically adapt their capabilities based on what other agents are available in the network.

## Artinet SDK

**Repository:** [the-artinet-project/artinet-sdk](https://github.com/the-artinet-project/artinet-sdk)

Artinet SDK takes a different approach: instead of being a single agent, it is a TypeScript SDK for building A2A agents quickly. Its tagline is "Ship Agent2Agent in one line of code." It uses LangChain under the hood and provides abstractions that let you stand up a code generation agent (or any other type) with minimal boilerplate.

**What it does:**

- Provides a high-level SDK for creating A2A-compliant agents in TypeScript
- Handles Agent Card generation, task routing, and response formatting automatically
- Integrates with LangChain for LLM orchestration
- Supports deploying agents with built-in A2A protocol compliance

**Strengths:**

- Fastest path from zero to a working A2A agent in TypeScript
- Abstracts away protocol details so you focus on business logic
- LangChain integration gives access to a wide range of LLM providers
- Apache 2.0 license

**When to use it:**

Use Artinet SDK when you want to build your own code generation agent rather than use someone else's. It is ideal for teams that need custom logic (proprietary code patterns, internal APIs, company-specific standards) wrapped in an A2A-compliant interface.

```typescript
import { ArtinetAgent } from "artinet-sdk";

const agent = new ArtinetAgent({
  name: "my-code-agent",
  description: "Generates TypeScript code following our internal standards",
  skills: [{ id: "generate", name: "Generate Code", tags: ["typescript"] }],
});
```

## Building a Code Generation Pipeline

The real power of A2A comes from composing these agents. Here is a practical pipeline:

1. **Artinet SDK agent** receives the initial request and plans the implementation
2. **Code Agent** generates the actual code
3. **Ag2 agent** runs an internal review loop to verify correctness
4. **Github Agent** creates a PR and handles the review process

Each agent runs independently, communicates over HTTP, and can be swapped out without changing the rest of the pipeline. That is the core value proposition of A2A for code generation.

## Choosing the Right Agent

- **Need PR reviews?** Start with Github Agent.
- **Need hosted code generation?** Use Code Agent on Modal.
- **Need self-correcting output?** Go with Ag2 for its multi-agent review loop.
- **Working in .NET?** Semantic Kernel A2A is your best fit.
- **Building custom agents?** Artinet SDK gets you there fastest in TypeScript.
